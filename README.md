# Linked List Implementation

An implementation of the linked list data structure. Assume that a given linked list is sorted and when inserting new nodes
maintain the sorted linkd list. Each node has an integer value. The head of the list should have the smallest value and the tail of the list
should have the largest.

## Edge Cases

1. If the head of the list is null, then the inserted node becomes the head.
2. If the value of the new node is equal to the value of the current node, the new node is inserted after the current node.
